A dataset for NLP - Sentiment Analysis in Italian language

Finding NLP resources and datasets for Italian Language can be challenging. In this repository you'll find a ready-to-use CSV file containing thousands of Customer Reviews regarding a plethora of different products that have been bought online. A few key facts about the Dataset:

- Schema is as follows: <RATING_1_TO_5>|<FULL_REVIEW_ITALIAN_TEXT>
- The Dataset is unbalanced. This is because random web scraping results in a Review Scores distribution that reflects the real-world Distribution of Customer Review Scores. That is, you'll find more Positive Reviews than Negative Reviews
- The Dataset will grow with time, but it's a useful resource for NLP even today (more that 90000 samples already)
- Dataset is split into 2 parts, "everglade_01.csv" and "everglade_02.csv", because the whole set is quite big. Just download both files from the link above
- Have fun!
